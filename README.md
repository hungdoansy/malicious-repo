# DON'T INSTALL ! DON'T INSTALL ! DON'T INSTALL !

This repo contains source codes from malicious repos that may have malware/ransomware.

I installed them on my laptop and got stolen. My wallets got drained out. Be very careful installing these source codes.

There are 2 repos I cloned, but I installed only the first one and it's of course the main culprit.
